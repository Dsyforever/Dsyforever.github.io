# About Me

I am currently a second-year PhD student at Dartmouth College. I am honored to be advised by Prof. [Yaoqing Yang](https://sites.google.com/site/yangyaoqingcmu/). Prior to this, I earned my Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics from South China University of Technology in 2024. My primary research interests lie in learning theory📊 and optimization📈.

## ✨Research Interests

I am interested in both classical learning theory problems (Rademacher Complexity, Covering Number, PAC-Bayesian, etc.) and recently emerging theory problems (primarily focusing on the statistical and optimization properties of large-scale deep neural networks). If you have any interesting related problems, feel free to discuss with me anytime! I am very open to cooperation.

My current research primarily focus on:

- Investigate **non-vacuous** and theoretically interpretable metrics for data/model statistical complexity in neural networks training, and determine how the interplay between data complexity and model complexity can lead to improved generalization and robustness performance.
- Analyze the loss landscapes of large-scale neural networks (CNNs, Transformers, etc.) and the behavior of optimization algorithms under specific loss landscapes, and develop scalable pre-conditional optimization algorithms based on the optimization properties of the loss landscapes.

I am a food enthusiast who loves both eating and cooking. I enjoy preparing a hearty dinner after a busy work schedule and then rewarding myself with a game of StarCraft II. Here are some photos of the dishes I have made: [See Gallery](/gallery/)
